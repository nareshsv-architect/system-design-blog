**What Is System Design?**
System design is about planning how a software system works as a whole.

Instead of writing code for a single feature, system design focuses on:

 - How different parts of the system talk to each other

 - How the system handles many users

 - How data is stored and retrieved

 - How the system stays reliable as it grows

In short:

System design = deciding the structure of a software system before building it.

**Why Do We Need System Design?**
When an application is small, simple code is enough. But as users grow:

 - Many people use the app at the same time

 - Data becomes large

 - The system must not crash

 - The app must stay fast

System design helps answer questions like:

 - What happens if 1 user becomes 1 million users?

 - How do we make the app fast?

 - How do we prevent failures?

 - What Does System Design Include?

At a beginner level, system design usually includes:

  i)  Frontend – what users see and interact with

 ii)  Backend – where business logic lives

 iii) Database – where data is stored

 iv)  APIs – how frontend and backend communicate

Later, we also think about:

  i) Load balancers

 ii) Caching

iii) Messaging systems

iv) Monitoring and logging

But as a starter, we don’t need to know everything at once.

A Very Simple Example

Think about designing a URL shortener.

Basic questions you would ask:

* Where do we store the original URL?

* How do we generate a short URL?

* How does the system redirect users?

Even this simple app needs system design thinking.

**System Design Coding**
----------------------------------------------
| Coding              | System Design        |
----------------------------------------------	      
| Writing functions	  | Designing architecture|
| Focus on logic	    | Focus on structure    |
| Works at code level	| Works at high level   |
-----------------------------------------------

Both are important. System design helps you decide what to code.

**Where Is System Design Used?**
 - Large applications (e-commerce, social media, banking)
 - Backend development
 - Cloud-based systems
 - Technical interviews

As Beginners; Lets Learn System Design simple:

 - Understand basic concepts
 - Learn common components
 - Study small case studies

Think in diagrams, not code
