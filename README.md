# system-design-blog

A starter-friendly system design blog.

This space is for learning and sharing system design concepts step by step, in a simple and practical way. The content will grow gradually as concepts become clearer.

**Purpose**

1. Learn system design from scratch

2. Break complex topics into simple explanations

3. Document learning with examples and diagrams

4. Build a strong foundation for interviews and real projects

This blog is intentionally minimal and beginner-focused.
